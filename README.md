# Introduction
Madmaan is a dynamically and strong typed language that simplifies JavaScript's
syntax and looks M A D S I C K, man. Hate semi-colons? Well, try out exclamation marks!
Does using "!" for "not" not make sense? Okay, use "NOT" instead, M A N. Plus,
we know how ugly {} can be. S O. N O. C U R L Y. B R A C K E T S, M A N.
This language explodes(compiles) into JavaScript, now go get M A D, M A A N.
